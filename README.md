# Luke
Luke is a 2D game that was the senior project for my Computer Science degree. It was a collaborative effort between a group of 6 people, and it displays the full range of a game: sound effects, visual design, level design, procedurally generated maps, and much more! To play Luke, you can play in the browser @ https://wereshenron.itch.io/luke
